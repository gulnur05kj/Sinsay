              <p>
                I wanted to create a radical new <br />
                skincare brand. For too long, the world <br />
                of skincare had been defined by <br />
                exaggerated promises and suspect <br />
                chemicals. After gathering a team of
                <br />
                health and skincare experts, we set out <br />
                together to challenge the industry. That
                <br />
                meant going back to basics.
                <br />
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                We wanted to take an autonomous <br />
                approach. Working from the ground up, <br />
                we built an online-only, direct to
                <br />
                customer model, which means we can <br />
                sell premium products with the highest <br />
                quality ingredients at a great price. <br />
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Staying true to our philosophy of <br />
                simplicity and transparency, we intend <br />
                to remain uncompromising in our <br />
                mission to offer consumers a premium <br />
                natural skincare alternative. <br />

          <h1>OUR FORMULATIONS</h1> <br />
          <p>
            Our philosophy is not to add anything to <br />
            our products to make them stand out; <br />
            instead we pare them back and distil each <br />
            formula down to the most-essential,
            <br />
            natural active ingredients. <br />
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We're tireless in our mission to hunt down <br />
            the best ingredients.Whether in France, <br />
            around Europe or further afield in search of <br />
            exotic extracts,they must be sourced from <br />
            sustainable farms using gentle extraction <br />
            techniques.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our formulas are simple, considered and <br />
            effective. Provenance is important to us, so <br />
            you'll always know where our ingredients <br />
            come from.And we'll even show you how <br />
            to create your own skincare formulations <br />
            along the way.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            All formulations are 100% French. Our <br />
            partner laboratories in Bergerac, Aix en <br />
            Provence and Compi√®gne work with us to <br />
            put their French skincare heritage to good <br />
            use. <br />

            <p>
              Since it began, our company has strived <br />
              to become more respectful of the <br />
              environment, have a positive impact on <br />
              society, and support customers with <br />
              straight-talking transparency. <br />
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Founded in 2006, the B Corp movement <br />
              brings together companies with a <br />
              common objective: to balance purpose <br />
              and profit by integrating social and <br />
              environmental commitments into their <br />
              economic models. <br />
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The idea is not to become the best in the <br />
              world, but to try to be better for the <br />
              world. B Corp certification allows us to
              <br />
              act on our need to have a positive impact
              <br />
              within our industry and society through
              <br />
              its implementation of concrete guidance
              <br />
              and assessments.
